    "Of course, the solution uses dynnamic programming. Let `dp[x]` represent the state. Initialize `dp[0]` to `0` since it takes `0` coins to make `0`, and all other entries to `amount+1` (since this will serve as an unattainable max value that will not affect the later `min` comparisons). Using a bottom-up approach (**tabulation**), we build the `dp[x]` array. We know from the *optimal substructure* property that the optimal answer for any amount `x` can be obtained from the optimal answer of previously calculated amounts. More specifcally, the optimal solution for an amount `x` is the minimum of the set of optimal solutions for all amounts `x - c` for all `c Îµ coins` + 1.\n",
