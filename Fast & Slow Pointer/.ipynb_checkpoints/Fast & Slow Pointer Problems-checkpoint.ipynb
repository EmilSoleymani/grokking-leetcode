While `slow != fast || !seen` if `fast.next` or `fast.next.next` are `null` return `null` since our fast pointer has reached the end of the list without reaching a cycle, else set `fast` to `fast.next.next` and `slow` to `slow.next`. Also set `seen` to `True`. We now have the point at which the `fast` and `slow` pointer intersected. This means we know there is a cycle. Now if we start a new pointer, `start`, at `head` again, and another pointer back at the intersection point and move them at the same pace their intersection point is the node where the cycle begins. So, while `start != fast` set `start` to `start.next` and `fast` to `fast.next`. Return `fast` (or `start`, they point to the same node).\n",

    "Since this problem is not set up as a LinkedList it may be hard to see that we are just detecting if we end up in a cycle before reaching one. Instead of having ListNodes with pointers to `next`, we will have a function `getNext(n)` which returns the sum of the square of all the digits of `n`. This takes us to our \"next\" node based on the deifnition of the problem. Given this function, it becomes a simple `fast` and `slow` pointer problem. Initialize `slow` to `n` and `fast` to `getNext(n)`. We need to loop until `fast` becomes `1` (where we want to return `true`) or until `slow` and `fast` are equal (a cycle is detected). So we can formulate this as while `fast != 1 || slow != fast` set `slow` to `getNext(slow)` and set `fast` to `getNext(getNext(fast))`. Once this loop terminates, we return `True` iff `fast == 1`, else a cycle was detected (i.e. `1` could never be reached).\n",
