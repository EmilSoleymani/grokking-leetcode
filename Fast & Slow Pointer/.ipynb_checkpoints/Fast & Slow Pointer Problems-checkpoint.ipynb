    "Since this problem is not set up as a LinkedList it may be hard to see that we are just detecting if we end up in a cycle before reaching one. Instead of having ListNodes with pointers to `next`, we will have a function `getNext(n)` which returns the sum of the square of all the digits of `n`. This takes us to our \"next\" node based on the deifnition of the problem. Given this function, it becomes a simple `fast` and `slow` pointer problem. Initialize `slow` to `n` and `fast` to `getNext(n)`. We need to loop until `fast` becomes `1` (where we want to return `true`) or until `slow` and `fast` are equal (a cycle is detected). So we can formulate this as while `fast != 1 || slow != fast` set `slow` to `getNext(slow)` and set `fast` to `getNext(getNext(fast))`. Once this loop terminates, we return `True` iff `fast == 1`, else a cycle was detected (i.e. `1` could never be reached).\n",

Upon termination of this loop, `slow` is pointing to the middle of the linked list. Now we must reverse the second half. Set `prev` to `null`. While `slow`,  set `currNode` to `slow`, `slow` to `slow.next`, `currNode.next` to `prev` and `prev` to `currNode`. Now, set pointers `first` and `second` to `head` and `prev`. While `second`, set `first` and `first.next` to `first.next` and `second` (**atomically**!), then set `second` and `second.next` to `second.next` and `first`(**atomically**!).\n",
